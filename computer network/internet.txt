//network = it is group of system of interconnected people or items
//computer networks = computer connected with each other with cablwe or wireless is called computer networkd
//internet = in a nutshell internet is a network pof computer network
complex web of interconnected computer network 
//arpanet = us developed the network for computer to talk with each other 

//dsl = digital suscriber line

//isp = internet servive provider 
(company that provide end users internet connection)

//cable networks/satellite networks/fibre networks

//protocols = set of rules and regulation tpo comunicate and share the data anbd informaton over the internet
examples = https,udp,

//packets = in order to share data we cant sent big chunk of data over the internet
so we devide the data to be sent in smaller chunks these small chunks are called as packets

//address = snding messeges over the nwtwork requires the destinetion details.this detail 
uiquily identify the end system is callred as address

//ports = many machines could be runig ma networks at a time. in order to distinguish
these apps for recieving messages we use ports (port number )

//ip-address + port = socket 

port help us to get the packet to specific process on the host

every process has a 16 bit port number 

//0 - 1023  well known ports
port 80 = http
port 443 = https

//network protocol stack = 1)osi.(7 layers)  2) tcp/ip(5 layers )

1)osi
//application layer = actual application
//presentation layer = presentation of data (encryption)
//session layer = user session management
//transport layer  = devides big chunck of data comming from above to small chunks and manage this chunks
//network = how routing of packets will be done on a network
//data link layer  = error/flow control. (multiplexing and demultiplexing)
//physical layer  = last layer 

1)application layer =   writing/providing data off the network,conytains application that helps users to interect o the network
error handling and recoviring can also be done.it exixts o end systems.

//how they work?
client-server application = TWO level architecture
servers = this process control access to a centralize resource or service such as website
client-side =frontend where user interects
server-side = 

//p2p architecture = multiple end systems connected with each other 

//http = hyper text transfer protocol
objects = web pages are the main objects that contain other objects
some oither objects can be a mp3 file,jpg file etc every object has an url.
it defines the whole proedure that how the client server will interact. 
http is also categorised in request-response protocols
http is stateless protocol(server do not store any information abt the client)
http depends upon tcp 

//methods= get,post,put,patch,delete


//http request and response 
//url  = uniform resource locater 

//cookies  = these are mainly conserned about privacy 
https is a stateless protocol and a lot of time user session is required 
//how cokies wrks?
cookies are unique idenfier string these are set by the servers through http headers 

//set cookie header =when a browser wants to set a cookie iit include "set-cookie:value"
this cookie is stored in the cookie file of the browser 

//Email:SMPT(simple mail transfer protocol)
for executing the functionality of email smtp is used one molre protocol is pop3 is use 
in combination with smtp
smtc also uses tcp protocol from transport layer 

//how smtp works
when an email is sent.it is sent to the senders smtp server using smtp protocol
(also the smtp server is configured in the mail client)
the smtp server place the email on the message queque
smtp sever initiates trhe connection with recievers smtp server and conduts an initial smtp handshale
then finaly it seds the email to recipents smtp server 
the email is downloaded from recievers smtp server and then the client shows the mail
smtp -> push protocol(used to send an mail)
pop3 = pull protocol(usaed for downloading the mail)


//pop3 = it downloads emaail in 4 stages
1)connect
2)authorize
3)transaction
4)update

//imap(internet message eccess protocol) = emails are kept on server and not deleted 
local copies are catched on each device 


//transport layer is a sandwich between application layer and network layer
//it has varipus parts..refer documentatiom


//TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL

//tcp protocol(transmission control protocol)
1)sends data
2)segment data
3) identify and retransmit message
3)reliable data transfer

//key features
1)connection oriented
2)full duplex
3)point to point transmission
4)error control
5)congetion control

//UDP (USER DATAGRAM protocol)

//simpler than tcp
//application that dont need relaiable delivery
it gets the data converts it into datagram and sends it to netword layer
//delivery of data is not gurenteed in upd

why usd?
it is faster(no load of acknowledgement)
reliebility can be build seperately

applications(XBOX)    
//INTERNET PROTOCOL
//ipv4 and ipv6
